# Pocket

**The on-chain marketplace that connects startups with growth, sales and marketing specialists, with every payment protected by escrow on Stellar.**

Startups post work and lock the budget in an escrow. Specialists deliver. Funds are released only when the deliverable is accepted, so the startup never pays for nothing and the specialist never works for free. Every user is reviewed by Pocket's team before they can operate, and every profile follows the same template so the marketplace stays easy to compare and looks premium.

## How it works

1. **Sign in with your Stellar wallet.** Freighter, xBull, Lobstr, Albedo and other wallets are supported through Stellar Wallets Kit. No passwords.
2. **Get verified.** A Pocket manager reviews every startup and specialist before they can use the marketplace.
3. **Fill in your profile.** Startups and specialists complete a fixed template, so every profile looks consistent.
4. **Hire.** A startup picks a specialist and the agreed amount is locked in a USDC escrow on Stellar through [Trustless Work](https://www.trustlesswork.com/).
5. **Deliver and get paid.** The specialist submits the deliverable, the startup approves it with their wallet and the escrow releases the funds. Disagreements are settled by a Pocket manager.

Pocket never holds user funds: each party signs their own escrow operations with their own wallet.
